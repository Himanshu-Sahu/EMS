# EMS Make Management Easier
The project started in June, 2017 summer under the guidance of Mr. Aman Verma(CEO and Founder of Webbnix) to make management of projects,
employees, salary etc easier. 

We decided to made this project in PHP because of its easy learning process, fast development and free supporting software on wordpress. 
Everyday we had a discussion related to project requirements and my work was to implement it as early as possible. EMS makes registration simpler and fast as employees only need to login and had to fill 2 or 3 fields. The admin can check information at anytime and anywhere related to project allotment, daily working hours, wages on the basis of working hours etc.

Result in user friendly website which makes Aman Sir work simpler and I learn many things at Webbnix...
